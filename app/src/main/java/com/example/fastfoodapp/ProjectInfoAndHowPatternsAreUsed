Use case
  The following use case is spread over the project This needs min three days for the participants to culminate
   Over view on KFC stores Which we have already worked on it.
   Porting builder and its acceptable ways.
   Arranging all the ingredient's names, calories and its cost.
   using a builder to hide the way we create a product( Burger )
 UI ->  recycler view creates various adapters to display the feel of the product (Day 3)
   Store it in prototype( as the threshold of the product reduces request the builder to construct more )
   Creating MVC for the communication layer
  As the user orders a Burger, Combo, meal plan   let's have all the plans designed in a composite
  The visitor is implemented to get the cost from the composite/builder ( Iterator is used to iterate over the product )
  Just in case the user changes the mind to have a double cheese Command helps us in navigation over created product
  When user orders a product it's created using the above layers and the observer notifies the user about the product created
Factory pulls the product from a  prototype and its kept ready for further billing process l ( library DLL  dependency )
The user has to move to the cash counter
The strategy works on accepting cash by Card, cash, or by Gpay.
as the product sells data is stored in MVVM
Ingredients, Customer info to is stored at MVVM
